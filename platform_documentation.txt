PLATFORM DOCUMENTATION: Cyberdeck Store
======================================

1. PLATFORM OVERVIEW
--------------------
This platform is a modern e-commerce web application designed for selling "Cyberdecks" (futuristic computing devices). It is built using the Next.js framework, prioritizing performance, SEO, and a premium user experience with rich animations and a responsive design.

2. LANGUAGES AND LOGIC
----------------------
The logic and structure of the platform are primarily built using the following languages:

*   **TypeScript (TS/TSX)**: This is the primary language used for both the frontend (UI components) and backend logic (API routes, server actions). It adds static typing to JavaScript for better code quality and maintainability.
*   **CSS (Tailwind)**: Styling is handled via Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Global styles and custom animations are defined in CSS, but most styling applies directly via classes in the TSX files.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: Used implicitly via Prisma ORM for database interactions, and explicitly in seed scripts (e.g., `reset-and-seed.sql`) to initialize the database schema and data.

3. TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------
The platform leverages a robust modern stack:

*   **Framework**: Next.js (v16) with the App Router architecture.
    *   **How it works**: Uses React Server Components (RSC) by default for performance, with Client Components used for interactive elements. Routing is file-system based within the `app/` directory.
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL.
    *   **How it works**: Acts as the relational database management system to store products, users, orders, etc.
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Prisma.
    *   **How it works**: Prisma connects the TypeScript application to the PostgreSQL database. It allows developers to interact with the database using type-safe methods (e.g., `prisma.user.findMany()`) instead of raw SQL queries.
*   **Authentication**: NextAuth.js.
    *   **How it works**: Manages user sessions, login/signup flows, and protects routes. It likely uses `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing.
*   **UI & Styling**:
    *   **Tailwind CSS**: For layout and styling.
    *   **Framer Motion**: For complex animations and page transitions.
    *   **Lucide React**: For scalable vector icons.

4. HOW IT WORKS (LOGIC FLOW)
----------------------------
1.  **User Request**: When a user visits the site, Next.js determines whether to serve a pre-rendered HTML page (Server Component) or hydrate an interactive element (Client Component).
2.  **Data Fetching**: Data (like product lists) is fetched directly on the server (in Server Components) via Prisma calls to the PostgreSQL database. This ensures fast initial page loads and better SEO.
3.  **Interactivity**: When a user interacts (e.g., clicks "Add to Cart"), JavaScript events trigger functions. For sensitive actions (like checkout or login), the frontend sends a request to a Server Action or API Route.
4.  **State Management**: React state handles local UI changes, while server-side data is revalidated largely automatically by Next.js's caching mechanisms.
